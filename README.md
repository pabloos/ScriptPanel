## ScriptPanel (not working on)

ScriptPanel is a web-bassed application for running scripts remotely. It was a final-project for a school subject

### Scripts languages supported

* Bash 4.4

* Perl

* Python 2.7

* Ruby

### Features

* client-server architecture

* based on docker-containers

### Not for production

For now it's an alpha version. I'm making tests, CI configuration and learning how to make it with security features. Also it is not a closed vision desgn, because I'm working on the logical layout.

But, well, it works.
